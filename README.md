# STAYAWAY COVID: a COVID-19 Social Distancing device

## About

This project was developed with two of my class teammates for the Computer Programing for Engineers class. 

## Description

To break the chain of transmission through enforcing COVID-19 physical distancing protocols, we have designed a wearable device to help you maintain a safe distance and protect yourself and the community from COVID-19. Its primary advantages are its simple and intuitive user interface and its confidentiality - it respects the user's privacy and does not record his/her GPS location at any time. No data is collected, stored nor shared at any point.
